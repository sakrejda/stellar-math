Adding: 1-10

Subtraction: 5-0

entry[k]: number, number, answer, vector<times> timing

Pr[K=k] = 0.1 + 0.9 * timing[k]/sum[timing]

Components: 
 - numbers 1:J
 - operators: +/-

Start with J = 1, K = 1:J

- Create map<operator, vector<entry>> for all k, 1:K

- Pick a k, look at entry[k]
  - Take number ("A")
  - Take number ("B")
  - Take operator
- Show question
- Record answer
- Check answer:
  - Wrong answer: go back to show question
  - Right answer: record time in entry[k]
